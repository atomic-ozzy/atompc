    <h1>HELLO!</h1>
    <h4>17th September, 2021</h4>
    <p>I know, this looks like an old web 1.0 site, I'll update it soon, I just wanted to get the website up and running for me to use<br><br>  Around a year ago, I started creating a small Raspberry Pi RetroPie environment... inside my lunchbox. I found a small metal lunchbox, added a pi to it, and gradually updated the design over time. Nowadays, I am very happy with my design, although still updating it. You do not require any 3D Printer, soldering, or any intense tools like that when you're just starting out. You take your design very far without use of these tools.</p>
